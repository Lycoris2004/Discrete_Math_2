    "1. The experiment consists of $n$ identical trials.\n",
    "2. The outcome of each trial falls into one of $k$ classes or cells.\n",
    "3. The probability that the outcome of a single trial falls into cell $i$, is $p_i,i = 1,2,...,k$ and remains the same from trial to trial. Notice that $p_1+p_2+p_3+···+p_k =1.$\n",
    "4. The trials are independent.\n",
    "5. The random variables of interest are $Y_1 , Y_2 , . . . , Y_k$, where $Y_i$ equals the number of trials for which the outcome falls into cell $i$. Notice that $Y_1 +Y_2 +Y_3 +···+Y_k =n$.\n",

What is the probability that at least nine of ten receiving the medication will recover?\n",
